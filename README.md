# MiniBar - React Cocktail Finder App
MiniBar is a Cocktail Search App that let's you search for cocktails built with React. 
I have used [The Cocktail DB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to fetch the data that displays a plethora of drinks. The ingredients, instructions and an image are shown. And to manage the state of the application I have used react Hooks. 

### Functionality to be added:
There is still a lot of work to do. Some stuff I want to implement are 
 1. ~~Add Search functionality~~ Search functionality added!
 2. ~~Add Random function/page~~ Random function and page added!
 3.   Add ingredients filter!
 4.   Always more room for refactoring!

# App Components: 
- React Native 
- React-Router-Dom 
- Cocktail DB API

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
